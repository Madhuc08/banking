	<h1>FOUNDED</h1>
	<p>Commercial banking in India can boast of a history of about 200 years. Though one could trace the history of banking back to the 19th Century, the beginning of the last century saw the birth of many banks in India, set up by people with vision, commitment and national spirit.

One such Bank - MARO - was set up in Karur in 1916 by two great visionaries and illustrious sons of Karur, the Late Shri M A Venkatarama Chettiar and the Late Shri Athi Krishna Chettiar to provide financial support to the traders and agriculturists in and around Karur, a textile town in Tamil Nadu.
